[Network Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science) is
the study of network representations of physical, biological, and
social phenomena leading to predictive models of these phenomena.

In this course, we will study networks, mainly following the book
[Networks, Crowds and Markets] by David Easley and Jim Kleinberg
(Cambridge UP 2010).  A pre-publication draft of the book can be
downloaded from its web page.

The plan is to work through the first 4 parts of the book
(leaving the remainder of the book for self-study), under the following titles:

1. Graph Theory (and Social Networks)

1. Game Theory

1. Markets and Strategic Interaction in Networks

1. Information Networks and the World Wide Web

This website serves as the repository for (some) lecture notes
from the course.  Feel free to add your thoughts
and further material through comments
or through pull requests on [github](https://github.com/cs423/cs423.github.io).
