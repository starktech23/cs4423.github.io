When networks are used to model real life relationships, simplifying
assumptions are made, leaving out aspects of the context in which for
example a social network is embedded.  Here we discuss such contextual
aspects and how they might be taken care of.

## Homophily

[Homophily] ("love of the same") is the tendency of individuals to
associate and bond with similar ones.  It has been observed to govern
the structure of social networks.

## Affiliation Networks

An affiliation network allows us to add context to a network, by
maintaining two distinct set of nodes, $X$ and $Y$,
and links only connecting nodes in $X$ with nodes in $Y$.
Such a network is called a **bipartite graph**.
Here, we use the set $X$ to represent people,
and $Y$ to represent foci, i.e., common interests, workplaces, etc.

## Segregation

The Schelling model: Suppose that people live on a grid,
and that there are two types $X$ and $O$.

An interactive implementation of the [Schelling] model.

Spatial Segregation happens even if no agent is actively seeking it.
