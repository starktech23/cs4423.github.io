Modern societies are in many ways highly connected.  Certain aspects of this
phenomenon are frequently described as _networks_:

* social networks (of friends)
* computer networks (the Internet)
* document networks (World Wide Web)
* academic networks (citations of scientific publications)
* transportation networks (road, rail, airline, subway)
* networks in biology (e.g., neural networks)
* financial networks
* ...

The remainder of this page is a paraphrasing summary of Chapter 1
(Overview) of the book [Networks, Crowds and Markets].

## 1. Aspects of Networks.

In a network, changes don't happen in isolation, and actions need to
be evaluated with the expectation that the world will react to whatever
you do.  Modifications to products, web sites, government policies,
that look like good ideas under the assumption that everything else
remains unchanged, can easily create incentives that shift behaviour
across the network in unintended ways.

Network effects happen regardless of whether we are able to actually
see the network or not.  Why do some ideas, tweets, videos get _viral_
and others don't?  To understand how such processes work and how they
are realized through the interconnected actions of many people, we
need to study the _dynamics of aggregate behavior_.

Understanding highly connected systems requires a set of ideas for reasoning about

* network structure,
* strategic behavior,
* and feedback effects across large populations.

The emerging interdisciplinary field of __Network Science__ draws on

* __Computer Science__, (Applied) __Mathematics__, and __Operations
Research__ for a language to talk about the complexity of network
structures, information and systems with interacting agents,
* __Economics__ for models for the strategic behavior of individuals
who interact with each other as members of larger aggregates,
* (Mathematical) __Sociology__ for theoretical frameworks for
the structure and dynamics of social groups.

The new field addresses shortcomings in the individual disciplines,
and builds on recent developments, such as the World Wide Web and the
many new contexts it provides for network data and network
applications,  thereby creating new opportunities to pose questions,
formulate theories and evaluate predictions about social networks.

One of the challenges arises from the fact that networks span many
levels of scale and resolution.  A small scale example of a network is
the 30-or-so person social network of the people in this class.  A
large scale example is the collection of interlinked web pages that
forms the World Wide Web, which is constantly searched for the most
relevant information.  It is a challenging scientific problem to
bridge these vastly different levels of scale so that predictions and
principles from one level can meaningfully be transferred to others.

## 2. Central Themes and Topics

We now introduce some of the main topics of this course
and the ways in which they further our understanding of networks.

__Graph Theory.__ In this context, graph theory is the study of
_network structure_.  We focus particularly on fundamental ideas from
social network analysis, for example the dichotomy of _strong ties_
versus _weak ties_.  This is an example of a general phenomenon in
social networks.  Strong ties, representing close and frequent social
contacts, tend to be embedded in tightly linked regions of the
network.  Weak ties on the other hand, representing more casual and
distant social contacts, tend to cut across those regions.  Such a
distinction suggests a way of thinking about a social network in terms
of its dense pockets of strong ties and the ways in which they
interact with each other through weaker ties.

__Game Theory.__ This is the study of _network behaviour_.  There are
numerous settings in which a group of people must simultaneously
choose how to act, knowing that the outcome will depend on the
decisions made by all of them.  For example, when choosing a route for
driving through a network of busy roads, the experienced delay through
traffic congestion depends on choices made by many, not only the
driver.  In this example, the network is a _shared resource_,
and the combined decisions of all its users will influence how efficiently
the resource is used.
Another example is that of bidding in an auction.  Again, a bidder's
success does not only depend on their own bidding strategy, but also
on the other bidders' strategies.

The following common framework allows us to study and make predictions
in these and a range of other situations.  We assume that in a
collection of individuals, each one chooses and then is committed to a
_strategy_, and that in the end each individual receives a _payoff_
depending on the strategies chosen by everyone.  A central idea in
this framework is the notion of an _equilibrium_, that is a state that
provides no individual with an incentives to unilaterally change their
strategy, even if they know how others will behave.

__Markets and Strategic Interaction in Networks.__ Graph theory
combined with game theory produces richer models of behaviour in
networks.  The interactions among buyers and sellers in a market
naturally form a network, whose internal structure encodes a lot of
information about the market, like how the success of different
participants is affected by their position in the market.

![medieval Europe][europ]

In medieval Europe, the physical movement of goods was costly and
difficult, and the economic outcome for a trading city could depend
significantly on where it was located in the underlying
transportation network.  Having a powerful position in a network
depends not just on having many connections, but also on more subtle
features such as the power of those you are connected to.

__Information Networks.__ The information we deal with online has a
network structure provided through the links between web pages.
Search engines, like Google, make extensive use of the network
structure (as opposed to the actual content of the pages searched) in
evaluating the quality and relevance of a web page, based not only on
the number of links it receives, but also on subtle aspects of its
position in the network.  For example, a page can be viewed as
prominent if it receives links from pages that are themselves
prominent.  As we will see, this seemingly circular notion of
prominence can be resolved through a more careful definition based on
a kind of equilibrium in the link structure.

The interaction between search engines and the authors of web pages
also provides an interesting example of feedback effects.  Whenever a
search engine introduces a new method for ranking their search
results, web page creators react and optimize their pages in ways that
achieve higher ranks.  This shows that improvements to search engines
cannot be designed under the assumption the Web itself will not be
affected by the change.  New search methods must be developed with
these feedback effects in mind.

## Summary

We hope to develop a network perspective as a powerful way of looking
at complex systems in general.  Networks provide a way of thinking
about social dynamics, economic interaction, online information,
designed technology and natural processes, and approaching such
systems with an eye toward their internal structural patterns and the
resulting rich feedback effects.
