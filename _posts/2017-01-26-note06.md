##  Shortest Paths

Recall that a __path__ in a network $G = (X, E)$
is a sequence $p = (x_0, x_1, \dots, x_k)$ of
nodes $x_i \in X$, $i = 0, \dots, k$, such that any
pair of consecutive nodes forms an edge in $G$, i.e.,
$\\{x_{i-1}, x_i\\} \in E$ for all $i = 1, \dots, k$.
The __length__ $l(p)$ of the path $p$ is the
number of edges, $l(p) = k$.

In many practical applications it is of interest to find
for a pair $x, y$ of nodes, one or all the paths form $x$ to $y$
connecting the two nodes with the fewest number of edges possible.
This is a more complex measure on a network than, say, the degree
of a node, and  we will need a more complex procedure, that is: an
algorithm, in order to answer such questions systematically.

Let's start with a proper definition.

<div class="note" markdown="1">
**Definition.** Let $G = (X, E)$ be a simple graph and let
$x, y \in X$.  Let $P(x, y)$ be the set of all paths from $x$ to $y$.
Then the __distance__ $d(x, y)$ from $x$ to $y$ is

$d(x, y) = \min \\{ l(p) : p \in P(x, y) \\}$,

the shortest possible length of a path from $x$ to $y$, and a __shortest path__ from $x$ to $y$ is a path $p \in P(x, y)$ of length $l(p) = d(x, y)$.

The __diameter__ $\mathrm{diam}(G)$ of the network $G$ is the length of the longest shortest path between any two nodes,

$$\mathrm{diam}(G) = \max \{ d(x, y) : x, y \in X \}$$.
</div>


##  Breadth First Search

Now we consider the following problem: Given a node $x \in X$, what
are the distances $d(x, y)$ for all nodes $y \in X$?  A systematic
procedure for finding these distances, and the shortest paths through
which they are realized, is given by the algorithm which is know in
Computer Science as __Breadth First Search__ (BFS).

In order to describe the algorithm step by step, let's call a node $y$
a __neighbor__ (or __friend__) of node $x$, if $\\{x, y\\}$ is an
edge, and let's denote by

$$N(x) = \{ y \in X : \{x, y\} \in E \}$$

the set of all neighbors of node $x$.  The algorithm works through the
network layer by layer, starting with the given vertex $x$ at layer
$0$ and all its friends at layer $1$. It then finds the friends of the
friends at layer $2$, and so on, until every node that can be reached
from $x$ by a path has been recorded, taking care that no node gets
recorded twice.  The layer of a node then corresponds to its distance
from the given node $x$.

We will see two versions of this algorithm, a simple one first, and
then a more efficient one.  In both cases, the distance results will
be collected in an array $(d_1, \ldots, d_n)$.
In the first version, we use a variable $d$ to keep track of
the current distance from $x$.

<div class="note" markdown="1">
**Breadth First Search, Version 0.**
Given a simple graph
$G = (X, E)$ and a vertex $x \in X$,
determine $d(x, y)$ for all nodes $y \in X$.

1. [Initialize.]  Suppose that $X = \\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\\}$
and that $x = x_j$.  Set $d_i \gets \perp$ (undefined) for $i = 1, \dots, n$.
Set $d_j \gets 0$ and $d \gets 0$.

2. [Loop.] For each vertex $x_k \in X$ with $d_k = d$:
     * for each neighbor $x_l \in N(x_k)$ with $d_l = \perp$:
         * set $d_l \gets d + 1$.

3. [Stop?] Stop if no neighbor $x_l$ with $d_l = \perp$ was found,
and return the array $(d_1, \dots, d_n)$.
Otherwise set $d \gets d + 1$ and repeat from step 2.
</div>

**Example.**
Consider the following network.

![bfs1]

In order to determine the distance from node $A$ to each node in the network,
we set up an array of distance values which initially looks like this:

$$\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
A & B & C & D & E & F & G & H & I & J & K \\ \hline
0 &   &   &   &   &   &   &   &   &   &
\end{array}$$

Now, with distance variable $d = 0$, we find all
nodes with distance set to $0$ in the table
(that is $A$ only), then find their neighbors
(that is nodes $B$, $C$, $D$ and $E$) and select those
whose distance value is currently undefined
(which is the case for all of $B$, $C$, $D$ and $E$).
Setting their distance to $d+1$ gives a new
array like this:

$$\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
A & B & C & D & E & F & G & H & I & J & K \\ \hline
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 &   &   &   &   &   &
\end{array}$$

Now, we increment the value of $d$ to $1$ and start
all over:  find all
nodes with distance set to $1$ in the table
(that is now nodes $B$, $C$, $D$ and $E$), then find their neighbors
(that is nodes $A$, $B$, $C$, $F$, $G$, $H$) and select those
whose distance value is currently undefined
(which is the case for $F$, $G$, and $H$).
Setting their distance to $d+1$ gives a new
array like this:

$$\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
A & B & C & D & E & F & G & H & I & J & K \\ \hline
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 &   &   &
\end{array}$$

Increment $d$ to $2$ and start again:
find all
nodes with distance set to $2$ in the table
(that is now nodes $F$, $G$, $H$), then find their neighbors
(that is nodes $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, $I$ and $J$) and select those
whose distance value is currently undefined
(which is the case for $I$ and $J$).
Setting their distance to $d+1$ gives a new
array like this:

$$\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
A & B & C & D & E & F & G & H & I & J & K \\ \hline
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 &
\end{array}$$

Once more, we increment $d$ to $3$,
find all
nodes with distance set to $3$ in the table
(that is now nodes $I$ and $J$), then find their neighbors
(that is nodes $F$, $G$, $H$ and $K$) and select those
whose distance value is currently undefined
(which is the case only for node $K$).
Setting their $K$'s distance to $d+1$ gives a new
array like this:

$$\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
A & B & C & D & E & F & G & H & I & J & K \\ \hline
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4
\end{array}$$

Now all the entries in the array are filled
and we can stop (although, technically the algorithm
instructs us to set up one more round with
$d = 4$, only to find that no more neighbors with
undefined distance values can be found).
The array now contains, for each node $y$ in the
connected component of node $A$
the distance $d(A, x)$.

The workings of the algorithm can be used to
make a layer-by-layer diagram of the network,
as follows.

![bfs2]

**Complexity.**
It can be shown that this version of the algorithm has complexity
$O(n^2)$, meaning that the time it needs to perform its task
grows with the square of the size of the network.

In the second version of the algorithm, we use a __queue__
(a first-in first-out buffer) to keep track of the node
whose neighbors are currently under consideration.
A queue is an array of values that comes with two basis operations:
one can __push__ a value to the end of the queue, and
one can __pop__ a value of the top of the queue (provided
the queue is not empty).
It can be shown that this version of the algorithm
in the common case a sparse network
has complexity $O(n)$, which is as good as one could hope for.

<div class="note" markdown="1">
**Breadth First Search, Version 1.**
Given a simple graph
$G = (X, E)$ and a vertex $x \in X$,
determine $d(x, y)$ for all nodes $y \in X$.

1. [Initialize.]  Suppose that $X = \\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\\}$
and that $x = x_j$.  Set $d_i \gets \perp$ (undefined) for $i = 1, \dots, n$.
Set $d_j \gets 0$ and initialize a queue $Q \gets (x_j)$.

2. [Loop.]
While $Q \neq \emptyset$:
   * pop node $x_k$ off $Q$
   * for each neighbor $x_l$ of $x_k$ with $d_l = \perp$:
       * push $x_l$ onto $Q$ and set $d_l \gets d_k + 1$.

3. [Stop.] Return the array $(d_1, \dots, d_n)$.
</div>

**Example.**
Using the same example as before, we start off with
a queue $Q = (A)$ and
an array
of distance values initialized as

$$\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
A & B & C & D & E & F & G & H & I & J & K \\ \hline
0 &   &   &   &   &   &   &   &   &   &
\end{array}$$

Now we repeat step 2 until we run out of nodes in the queue.

First, $A$ gets popped off the queue (leaving $Q = ()$ empty for now)
and its neighbors $B$, $C$,  $D$ and $E$ in turn
are pushed onto the queue and get distance $1$ assigned.
At this point $Q = (B, C, D, E)$ and the distance array looks like

$$\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
A & B & C & D & E & F & G & H & I & J & K \\ \hline
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 &   &   &   &   &   &
\end{array}$$

Next, $B$ gets popped off the queue (resulting in
$Q = (C, D, E)$) and of its neighbors $A$, $C$ and $F$
only node $F$ is pushed onto the queue,
with distance $2$ assigned (that is $B$'s distance $1$, plus $1$).
Now $Q = (C, D, E, F)$ and the distance array has

$$\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
A & B & C & D & E & F & G & H & I & J & K \\ \hline
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 &   &   &   &   &
\end{array}$$

And so on, until finally, with $Q = (K)$, node $K$ is popped off,
no new neighbors are added, and the algorithm terminates with
an empty queue (and the same completed distance array as before)
on the next iteration.

**Variants.**
BFS is an extremely versatile algorithm, which applies in many different
situations and can be adapted to produce additional information
on a network.

For example, BFS run on a node $x$ in a network $G = (X, E)$
determines the __connected component__ of $X$ in $G$
(as the set of all nodes that get a distance value assigned).

With little more work (and an additional array) BFS can produce
a __spanning tree__ (or __shortest path tree__).
Here, whenever node $x_l$ is pushed onto $Q$, it is assigned
the current node $x_k$ (in the additional array)
as its predecessor on a shortest path from $x_j$ to $x_l$.
The subgraph of the network consisting of these edges is a tree.
As a tree, it has exactly one path between the given node $x$
and any of its
vertices $y$ and, by construction, this path is a shortest path
between $x$ and $y$.

**Example.**  Continuing the above example,
the egdes of the spanning tree here are highlighted in blue.

![bfs3]

The corresponding array lists for every node (except for $A$) its
parent in the rooted tree with root $A$.

$$\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
A & B & C & D & E & F & G & H & I & J & K \\ \hline
  & A & A & A & A & B & D & D & F & G & I
\end{array}$$

A further small modification of BFS makes it possible to record __all
shortest paths__ between the given node $x$ and the vertices $y$ in its
connected component.

Of course, in order to find distances, or shortest paths
between **all pairs** of nodes $x$ and $y$ in a network, one can
perform BFS for each of the vertices $x \in X$ in turn.

The algorithm and its variants also works on directed networks,
but the results then will have to be interpreted in the context of
directed networks.

More about BFS can be found in [Newman, Section 10.3].
