## Small Worlds

Some social networks have become very accessible for systematic
investigations, as they manifest themselves in a digital form on the
internet.  One such example of a social network that is accessible
online is maintained by the American Mathematical Society (AMS) as
part of [MathSciNet], a database of mathematical research publications.

This network is formed by a _collaboration graph_: its **nodes** are
the mathematical researchers, and two researchers are connected by and **edge**
whenever they have jointly authored a publication in the database.
In this network, the **Erdős number** of a mathematician is their
distance from the Erdős node.   This number can be computed by Breadth First Search.  The AMS offers this as a service on a dedicated
[collaboration distance page].

The hungarian mathematician Paul [Erdős] (1913-1996) is very
well-known for his publication records, with more than 1500
publications, and more than 500 collaborators.  It turns out, that
most mathematicians have an Erdős number of 4 or 5.  In fact,
random spot checks seem to indicate that virtually all mathematicians
are connected
with each other in this network (in a big giant component),
and that any two of them are rarely further than distance 6 apart.

This is an instance of a phenomenon that has often been observed:
social networks tend to have very short paths between arbitrary pairs of
people.  Such a network is called a **small world network**.
In popular culture, the phenomenon is known as "six degrees of separation".
It goes at least back to experiments conducted in the 1960s
by the Yale psychologist Stanley [Milgram] (who is even better known
for another [experiment] designed by him).

In a similar way, the **co-star graph** (with actors as nodes, and edges
between two actors whenever they starred in a common film) as
maintained by the [IMDb], has been used to define the **Bacon number**
of an actor as their distance to the American actor [Kevin Bacon].

The presence of short paths certainly has some relevance in relation
to the potential speed of information (or diseases) travelling through
the network.

## Triadic Closure

Networks evolve over time, edges come and go.  Triadic closure
is concerned with the presence of _triangles_ in a network:
if node $A$ is connected to nodes $B$ and $C$, is $B$ connected to $C$?

**Clustering Coefficient.**
A set of nodes in a graph with the property that
any two distinct nodes are joined by an edge is called
a **clique** (in other words, a clique is a subset of the nodes
such that the induced subgraph is complete).

The graph below contains two cliques of four nodes each.
![Cliques in a graph][cliques]

A clique of $m$ nodes has $\binom{m}2 = \frac12 m(m-1)$ edges,
e.g., a clique of $4$ nodes has $\frac{4 \cdot 3}2  = 6$
edges.

The clustering coefficient of a node A measures, how close
the set $F(A)$ of friends of $A$ comes to being a clique:
if the induced subgraph on $F(A)$ has $f$ edges, then the
**clustering coefficient** of the node $A$ is defined as the fraction
$f/\binom{m}2$.
This is a number between $0$ and $1$.

Triadic closure increases the clustering coefficient.  In a social
network, there are incentives for triadic closure to happen.  If
person $A$ is friends with $B$ and $C$, this provides opportunities for $B$
and $C$ to meet and become friends.  On the other hand, $B$ not being
friends with $C$ can be a source of stress for $A$, who has to attend to
their friends separately.  More generally, a lower clustering
coefficient can mean that more work is required to maintain a circle
of friends.

## Bridges; local Bridges

An edge $AB$ is called a **bridge** if deleting the edge would cause $A$
and $B$ to lie in different connected components.  (In other words, if
the edge $AB$ is a bridge then it is the only route from $A$ to $B$).

**Example.**  The edge $AB$ in the graph below is clearly a bridge.

This notion might not be very useful for the study of social networks,
as cycles and short paths make bridges very rare, or computationally
expensive to detect.

More interesting than the _global_ notion of a bridge, is the
_local_ notion of a local brigde.

An edge $AB$ is a **local bridge** if $F(A) \cap F(B) = \emptyset$,
i.e., if $A$ and $B$ have no friends in common.

**Example.**  The edge $AB$ in the graph below is a local bridge.

![picture1]

Deleting a local bridge $AB$ increases the distance between
$A$ and $B$ to at least 3.
This new distance is called the **span** of the local bridge.

A local bridge is the conceptual opposite of triadic closure:
an edge $AB$ is a local bridge if and only it is not involved in
any triangle.  (Proof?)
