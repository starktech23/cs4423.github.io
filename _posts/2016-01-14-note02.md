## Graphs and Social Networks

# Definitions and Basic Properties

**Definition.** A (simple) __graph__
is a pair $G = (X, E)$, consisting of a (finite) set $X$ of 
objects, called __nodes__ or __vertices__ or __points__,
and a subset $E \subseteq \binom{X}{2}$
of __links__ or __edges__.
Here, $\binom{X}{2}$ is the set of all $2$-element subsets of $X$.
(The notation is motivated by the fact that if $X$ has $n$ elements then
$\binom{X}{2}$ has $\binom{n}{2} = \frac12 n(n-1)$ elements.)

**Example.**
$X = \\{ A, B, C, D \\}$ and $E = \\{ AB, BC, BD, CD \\}$
(where $AB$ is short for $\\{ A, B \\}$).

var width = 500,
    height = 150;

var color = d3.scale.category10();

var force = d3.layout.force()
    .charge(-200)
    .gravity(0.05)
    .linkDistance(80)
    .size([width, height]);

var svg = d3.select("#example1").append("svg")
    .attr("width", width)
    .attr("height", height);

d3.json("/data/example1.json", function(error, graph) {
  force
      .nodes(graph.nodes)
      .links(graph.links)
      .start();

  var link = svg.selectAll(".link")
      .data(graph.links)
    .enter().append("line")
      .attr("class", "link")
      .style("stroke", function(d) { return color(d.value); })
      .style("stroke-width", function(d) { return 4; });

  // Create the groups under svg
  var groups = svg.selectAll('g.group')
    .data(graph.nodes)
    .enter()
    .append('g')
    .classed('group', true);

  var node = groups
      .append("circle")
      .attr("class", "node")
      .attr("r", 5)
      .style("fill", function(d) { return color(d.group); })
      .call(force.drag);

  node.append("title")
      .text(function(d) { return d.name; });

  var label = groups
      .append("text")
      .attr("dx", 6)
      .text(function(d) { return d.name; });

  // Merge images and text for update.
  node = svg.selectAll("circle, text");

  force.on("tick", function() {
    link.attr("x1", function(d) { return d.source.x; })
        .attr("y1", function(d) { return d.source.y; })
        .attr("x2", function(d) { return d.target.x; })
        .attr("y2", function(d) { return d.target.y; });

  // Translate the groups
  groups.attr("transform", function(d) { 
    return 'translate(' + [d.x, d.y] + ')'; 
  });    

//    node.attr("cx", function(d) { return d.x; })
//        .attr("cy", function(d) { return d.y; });
  });
});

</script>

The example also illustrates a typical way how diagrams of graphs are drawn:
nodes are represented by small circles, and edges by lines connecting the nodes.

In this simple setting, two nodes are either connected or not (that
is, there are no multiple links) and if node $x$ is connected to node
$y$, then it is also true that $y$ is connected to $x$: the edges set
up a _symmetric_ relationship between nodes.  If we want to express
more complex real world relationships, we can make use of the more
complex structure of _directed_ graphs, where edges have directions
(drawn as arrows), possibly pointing back to the node they came from
(forming loops), or even with multiple edges between the same two
nodes.


# Graphs are Relations

Recall the following definitions.

**Definition.**  A __relation__ from a set $X$ to a set $Y$ is (nothing but) a subset
$R$ of the Cartesian product $X \times Y = \\{(x, y) :  x \in X,\, y \in Y \\}$.
We say that $x \in X$ is __$R$-related__ to $y \in Y$ whenever $(x, y) \in R$.

If $Y = X$, we say that $X$ is a relation __on__ $X$.  Such a relation
can have one or more of the following properties.

* (R) $R$ is __reflexive__ if $(x, x) \in R$ for all $x \in X$;
* (S) $R$ is __symmetric__ if $(x, y) \in R$ implies $(y, x) \in R$ for all $x, y \in X$;
* (T) $R$ is __transitive__ if $(x, y) \in R$ and $(y, z) \in R$ imply that $(x, z) \in R$ for all $x, y, z \in X$;

* (I) $R$ is __irreflexive__ if $(x, x) \notin R$ for all $x \in X$;
* (A) $R$ is __antisymmetric__ if $(x, y) \in R$ and $(y, x) \in R$ imply that
$x = y$ for all $x, y \in X$.

A relation that is (RST, i.e., reflexive, symmetric and transitive) is called an __equivalence relation__,
and it partitions the set $X$ into (mutually disjoint)
parts, called __equivalence classes__.
A relation that is (RAT) is called a __partial order__
(such as the *divides* partial order on the natural numbers,
or the *contains* relation between the subsets of a set).

In view of these notions, we can now describe simple graphs and some
as follows: A *simple* graph with node set $X$ is a *symmetric*,
*irreflexive* relation on $X$.  A *directed* graph with node set $X$
is *irreflexive* if it has *no loops*.  And it is *antisymmetric* if
every edge has a *unique direction*.

The article [Counting Transitive Relations] (in the *Journal of
Integer Sequences*) contains a systematic account on the various types
of relations that can be distinguished by these 5 properties, and a
discussion of how to count them (up to equivalence) in case the
underlying set $X$ is finite.


<div class="note">
    A graph can serve as a mathematical model of a network.
</div>

**Example.**  The internet in December 1970.  Nodes are computers,
connected by a link if they can directly communicate with each other.
At the time, only 13 computers participated in that network.

# Fundamental Concepts: Paths and Connectivity

A **path** in a graph is a sequence of nodes, linked by an edge if
adjacent in the sequence.

**Example:** MIT-BBN-RAN-UCLA is a path in the graph above.

Such a graph can have repeated nodes.  If it doesn't, the path is
called a **simple path**.  The **length** of a path is the number of
*edges* it involves (that is the number of nodes, minus 1).  At each
vertex $x$, there is a unique path of length zero, consisting only of
that vertex $x$.

A **cycle** is a path of length at least 3 that is simple, except for
the first and last nodes being the same.

**Example:**  SRI-STAN-UCLA-UCSB-SRI is a cycle in the graph above.

Note that each edge (and node) of the 1970 Internet graph belongs to
a cycle.  This provides the other way around the cycle as an alternative
route in case one of the edges should fail.

Cycles in social networks are often a source of amusement, when
discovered ...

**Connectivity.** A graph is **connected** if, for
every pair of nodes, there is a path between them.

(Communication and transportation networks tend to be connected, as
this is their main purpose: to connect.)

**Components.** If a graph is not connected, it naturally breaks into pieces,
its **connected components**.

The relation 'there is a path from $x$ to $y$ on the node set $X$ of a
graph is the **transitive closure** of the graph relation 'there is an
*edge* between $x$ and $y$'.  It is *reflexive* (as each node $x$ is
connected to itself by the zero length path starting and ending at
$x$), *symmetric* (as a path from $x$ to $y$ can be used backwards as
a path from $y$ to $x$), and transitive (as a path from $x$ to $y$ and
a path from $y$ to $z$ together make up a path from $x$ to $z$), hence
an *equivalence relation*.  The connected components of the graph are
the parts (equivalence classes) of the corresponding partition of $X$.

**The Giant Component.** Large, complex networks often have one giant
component that contains a significant proportion of the nodes.
Erdős and Rényi (1960) have found this to be almost certainly the case
with a [random graph] on $n$ vertices with $\frac{n}{2}$ edges.
