Newman (Chapters 2-5) broadly divides the most commonly studied
real world networks into four classes:

* technological networks,
* social networks,
* information networks and
* biological networks.

There is of course some overlap between these classes.  But it is an
interesting exercise to list important examples within each class, and
to describe their general structure, and the techniques used to
discover and measure this structure in each example.


## Technological Networks

Technological networks rely on a physical infrastructure.  In many
cases, this infrastructure has been built over many decades and forms
part of the backbone of modern societies.  This includes road and
other transportation networks, power grids, and the telephone network.  A
relatively young example in this class of networks is the internet.


### The internet

The internet is the worldwide network of physical data connections
between computers and related devices.  In this network, the vertices
are the computers, and the edges are the physical connections like
optical fibre lines.

The actual structure of the internet is somewhat difficult to determine,
due to the lareg number of nodes and vertices involved, and since
its topology is not controlled by a central authority.

Overall, the internet is composed of three layers, or circles.

* The innermost circle is the _backbone_ of the network, providing
long-distance high-bandwidth data transport around the globe.
The backbone is operated by _Network Backbone Providers_ (NBP)
like national governments or big telecommunication companies.

* The second circle  consists of _Internet Service Providers_ (ISP)
such as universities,  commercial companies and governments, which link up
with each other and NBPs and provide internet access to the end users.

* These end users, businesses, academics and other people using computers
form the third and outer circle of the internet.

This hierarchical description of the internet however
captures only one small aspect of its structure.  More detailed data can
be obtained by monitoring actual journeys of data packages
over the internet, for example with the Unix `traceroute` utility.

The [Internet Mapping Project] started in 1998 to collect such data
systematically and has resulted in many visual impressions of the
structure of the internet like the one below.

### The telephone network

The telephone network is the network with telephones as its vertices
and landlines and wireless links as its edges.  It is one of the
oldest communication networks still in use.  The recent advent of
mobile phones has resulted in a drastic rise of the number of vertices
in the network, but it hasn't much changed the structure of the
telephone network, as mobile phone calls too are transmitted across
landlines for most of the way.

Similar to the Internet, the telephone network has basically a three
tiered structure consisting of

* a layer of telephones, connected to
* a layer of local exchanges, which are in turn connected to
* a layer of long-distance offices.

The long  distance offices are connected
amongst themselves, and so are some of the local exchanges.
This three-level topology can exploit the fact that most phone calls
are local calls.

The exact structure of the telephone network is known, but not easily
accessible as this information is mainly owned by the telephone
companies.

In contrast to the Internet, the telephone network traditionally is _circuit
switched_ (where a collection of lines, or ciruits, between points on
the network is reserved to a call for the duration of that call) and
not _packet switched_ (where the information to be submitted is broken
up into small packages, each of which travelling independently across
the network to their common destination, where they are reassembled).

### Power grids

A power grid is a network of high-voltage transmission lines that
provide long distance transport of electricity within and between
countries.  The vertices in this network are generating stations and
switching stations.  The edges are the high-voltage lines between the
stations.  The topology of a powergrid is usually well documented,
e.g., in the form of a map published and maintained by the authority
overseeing the grid.

[Eirgrid](http://www.eirgridgroup.com/) is the state-owned company
that manages and operates the transmission grid across the island of
Ireland.  (Click on the image below to get a detailed map.)

[![Transmission Map](/images/TransmissionMap.jpg)](http://www.eirgridgroup.com/site-files/library/EirGrid/2016-Transmission-System-Geographic-Map.pdf)

Power grids are very complicated systems.  They can display
surprising behaviour such as cascading failures, leading to large scale
power outages.  The flow of power in a grid depends on a variety of
factors, in addition to the bare topology of the network.

### Transportation networks

Transportation networks connect geographical locations
by physical links such as roads, railway lines or airline routes.
Due to their physical manifestation on th face of the earth,
such networks are usually easy to visually by a flat drawing,
or a planar graph in mathematical terms.

Transportation networks are typically well documented in the form of
maps and have been studied for a long time, for example with a view to
economical implications of the network structure.  Or to guide the
users of the network: the [London Tube
Map](http://content.tfl.gov.uk/standard-tube-map.pdf) omits
geographical details in favour of the bare network structure.  This
now universal design of subway and other public transport maps was
pioneered by the British electrical designer [Harry
Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Beck) in 1931.

Closely related to transportation networks are delivery or
distribution networks, like systems of oil or gas pipelines, water and
sewerage lines, or the postal network for the delivery of mail.  A
particular kind of natural delivery network is provided by river
networks.  This example of a type of network is special in the sense
that it contains _no loops_, and thus resembles a tree.  In fact, _tree_
is precisely the term used in graph theory, to descibe a connected
network without loops.  Another property of a river-like network worth
pointing out is its natural sense of _direction_ coming from the fact
that water only flows downhill.

## Social Networks

The vertices of a social network are people, with edges
representing some sort of social interaction, like friendship.
In sociology, the vertices are often called _actors_, and the edges
are called _ties_.

### Empirical Study

A social network's existence does not depend on social networking
sites like `facebook`, `twitter` or `linkedin`.  Real ties between
real people are much more subtle and hence more difficult to detect
and record, than explicit 'likes' or lists of 'friends'.  Sociologists
have studied social networks long before people started exhibiting
their relations to others online.

Traditionally, data about the structure of social networks have been
compiled by interviewing the people involved.  There are certain
issues in relation to the accuracy of information gained in this way.
People might understand the interviewer's questions in different ways,
they might not always answer truthfully.  Friendship, in theory, is a
_symmetric_ concept.  I am your friend if and only if you are my
friend.

Being asked independently, might reveal that I think we are
friends while you believe we're not.  That's why data obtained from
interviews has to be used with care.  This also applies to data
obtained from social media sites, for similar reasons.
Links in social networks are not as clear cut as they
are in a network that is built on a physical infrastructure.
An exception to this observation is maybe given by links
that are defined via common affiliations.

### Affiliation Networks

An affiliation network has two types of nodes, one type representing
people and another type representing groups of people.  These groups
might be defined by club membership, common interests, events
attended, etc.  Links only exist between people and groups.  Each link
involves exactly one node of each type, no two nodes of the same type
are ever linkes.  In mathematical terms, an affiliation network is an
example of a _bipartite graph_, a graph whose vertices are either
black or white, say, and whose links connect black with white
vertices, and nothing else.

Classical examples of affiliation networks in the sociology literature
include the "Southern Women Study" from 1941, relating a set of 18 society
women in a particular city to a set of 14 social events thay attended,
according to reports in the local press.  Another study relates the CEOs of
Chicago based companies in the 1970s to the clubs they were members of.

Network science techniques can be used to identify groups of closely related
people in such a network.  For this, the affiliation network can be projected
onto the set of people, defining a new network which has only the people
as vertices, with a link between two whenever they have a common affiliation.
This process is a common change of point of view which not only applies to
social networks.

## Information Networks

An information network consists of data items
which are linked to each other in some way.
This happens for example in every relational database.
Like social networks, an information network does not need
computers to exist.  Bits of information
(like scientific publications) have been
linking to each other (e.g., through citations)
long before computers were invented.
However, links in digital form are usually easier to follow
than vague references to items stored in a different building (or city),
and thus support a more intense experience of network structure.

### The (World Wide) Web

The WWW is probably the most wied spread and best known examples of an
information network.  Its nodes are web pages containing information
in form of text and pictures, and its edges are the hyperlinks,
allowing us to surf, or navigate from page to page.

Hyperlinks run in one direction only, from the page that contains the
hyperlink to the page that is referenced.  Therefore, the WWW is a
directed network, a graph where each edge has a direction.

The WWW was invented arounnf 1990 at the CERN high-energy physics
laboratory in Geneva as a way of sharing information between the
scientists and their collaborators.  It soon beacame clear that its
potential was far greater, leading to an unexpected sudden growth in
the number of pages and links.

This fast and uncontrolled growth makes it difficult to analyse the
structure of the WWW in detail.  On the other hand, the digital nature
of this network makes it possible to leave the task of exploring to
machines, so-called robots or web crawlers, who search a given web
page for hyperlinks, then follow those links, and search the pages
they arrive at, over an over again.

Search engines like google use web crawlers on a massive scale, to
classify and index all web pages that cound be found, in a way that
allows a speedy listing of interesting pages, based on one or more
keywords.

### Citation Networks

A citation network consists of academic papers and the citations
between them.  Citations are usuallly listed in a bibliography at the
end of a paper, and as such are well-documented.  As a citation points
from one paper to another (and not back), the resulting network is
directed, like the WWW.

There are many reasons why one paper might cite another: to point to
additional useful information, to give credit, or to disagree with the
content or point out some error in paper.

Bibliometrics is the branch of information science that deals with the
statistical study of publications and citiations.  There are now a
number of online services concerned with the collection and
distribution of bibliometric data, such as citeseer, scopus, and
google scholar.  The American Mathematical Society has been
collecting reviews of mathematical papers for decades.  These
days their database of reviews and citations can be accessed [online](http://www.ams.org.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/mathscinet/index.html).

It is tempting to use crude and readily available bibliometrical data
as sole indicators of the value of scientific work.  There is a
growing concern within the scientific community about a worrying trend
of this kind of evaluation becoming more wide spread.

## Biological Networks

Networks are widely used in many branches of biology as a convenient
representation of patterns of interaction between biological elements.

### Biochemical networks

Biochemical networks represent molecular level patterns of interaction
and control mechanisms in the biological cell. One distinguishes between

* metabolic networks,
* protein-protein interaction networks and
* genetic regulatory networks.

**Metabolism** is the chemical process by which a cell breaks down food
or other nutrients into smaller blocks and then reassembles those blocks
to form the biological molecules needed to complete other tasks.
This breakdown and reassembly process can involve chains or pathways
of successive chemical reactions, involving different groups of blocks at
each step.  The complete set of all possible reactions and all the pathways
forms a **metabolic network**.

The most precise representation of a metabolic network
uses a bitpartite graph, like an affilition network.
Here one type of  vertices are _metabolites_,
the chemicals produced and consumed by the reactions.
The other type of vertices represents the reactions themselves.
Metabolites then are linked to the reactions they participate in.
Arrows on the edges can be used to distinguish between
ingoing and outgoing metabolites.

A third type of vertices can be used to represent enzymes which
catalyze certain reactions (but are not consumed by them).  The
resulting graph then is a partly directed and partly undirected
tripartite network.

In practice, however, the most common representation of a metabolic
network is a projection on the set of metabolites, with an edge
between any two of them, if they participate in a common reaction.


In a **protein-protein interaction network** the vertices are proteins and
two vertices are connected by an undirected edge if the corresponding
protein interact, physically rather than chemically.

Proteins are long-chain molecules formed by the concatenation of a
series of basic units called amino acids. Once created, a protein
folds on itself in a form whose shape depends on the amino acid
sequence.  The folded form dictates the physical interaction it can
have with other molecules.

Again, a bipartite network could be used as a more faithful
representation of protein-protein interaction, with proteins and
interactions as different types of vertex, and undirected edges
connection proteins to the interactions in which they participate.


Here comes the network. Being proteins, transcription factors are
themselves produced by transcription from genes, and the transcription
process is regulated by other transcription factors, which again are
proteins, and so forth. The complete set of such interactions forms a


A **genetic regulatory network** also has proteins as its vertices, or
equivalently the genes that code for them.  There is a directed edge
from gene A to gene B indicating that A regulates the expression of B.
One can distinguish between promoting and inhibiting transcription
factors, by giving the network two distinct types of edges.
A more detailed description of this relationship between proteins follows.

A protein's amino acid sequence is determined by a corresponding
sequence stored in the DNA of the cell in which the protein is
synthesized.  The DNA code for a single
protein, from start to stop codon, is called a gene.
The process of creating a protein from a gene via a
copy of the gene made of RNA is called expressing the gene.

It is important for the cell to respond to its environment by turning
on or off the production of individual proteins. It does this by the
use of transcription factors, which are themselves proteins. The
presence in the cell of the transcription factor for the gene turns on
or enhances the expression of that gene, or inhibits it, depending on
the type of transcription factor.

### Neural networks

The primary information processing element in the brain is the neuron,
a specialized brain cell that combines several inputs to generate a
single output.  A typical neuron consists of a cell body, along with a
number of protruding tentacles, called dendrites, which are input
wires for carrying signals in the cell. Most neurons have only one
output, called the axon, which is typically longer than the
dendrites. It usually branches near its end into axon terminals to
allow the output of the cell to feed the input of several others.

The signals that travel within neurons are electrochemical in nature.
Transmission of a signal from one neuron to the next happens through
chemical neuro-transmitters.  The receiving neuron sums the inputs
from its dendrites and as a result may or may not send an output
signal down its own axon.  Inputs can also be inhibiting; signals
received at inhibiting inputs make the receiving neuron less likely to
fire.

At the simplest level, a **neural network** can be represented as a set of
vertices, the neurons, connected by two types of directed edges, one
for excitatory inputs and one for inhibiting inputs. In practice,
neurons are not all the same. This variation can be encoded in the
network representation by different types of vertices.

### Ecological networks

**Ecological networks** are networks of ecological interactions
between species. Species in an ecosystem can interact in different
ways: they can eat one another, they can parasitize one another, or
they can have any of a variety of mutually advantageous interactions,
such as pollination or seed dispersal.

A **food web** is a directed network that represents which species
prey on which others in a given ecosystem. The vertices of the network
correspond to species and the directed edges to predator-prey
interactions. In fact, ecologists conventionally draw edges in the
opposite direction, from prey to predator, that is, in the direction
of energy flow. Food webs are typically directed acyclic graphs
(DAGs). The acyclic nature of food webs indicate that there is an
intrinsic hierarchy among the species in ecosystems.

Those higher up the hierarchy prey on those lower down, but not vice
versa, although there are some counterexamples. A species's position
in this hierarchy is called by ecologists its trophic level. This is
the rank of the species' vertex on the acyclic food graph, that is the
length of the longest path leading to the vertex representing the
species. Those species in lower trophic levels tend to be smaller and
more abundant, while those in higher trophic positions are usually
larger-bodied and less numerous predators.
