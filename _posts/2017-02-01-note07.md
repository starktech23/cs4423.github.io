## Small Worlds

Some social networks have become very accessible for systematic
investigations, as they manifest themselves in a digital form on the
internet.  One such example of a social network that is accessible
online is maintained by the American Mathematical Society (AMS) as
part of [MathSciNet], a database of mathematical research publications.

This network is formed by a _collaboration graph_: its **nodes** are
the mathematical researchers, and two researchers are connected by and **edge**
whenever they have jointly authored a publication in the database.
In this network, the **Erdős number** of a mathematician is their
distance from the Erdős node.   This number can be computed by Breadth First Search.  The AMS offers this as a service on a dedicated
[collaboration distance page].

The hungarian mathematician Paul [Erdős] (1913-1996) is very
well-known for his publication records, with more than 1500
publications, and more than 500 collaborators.  It turns out, that
most mathematicians have an Erdős number of 4 or 5.  In fact,
random spot checks seem to indicate that virtually all mathematicians
are connected
with each other in this network (in a big giant component),
and that any two of them are rarely further than distance 6 apart.

This is an instance of a phenomenon that has often been observed:
social networks tend to have very short paths between arbitrary pairs of
people.  Such a network is called a **small world network**.
The name refers to the property that the diameter
$\mathrm{diam}(G)$, or the average distance
$$\frac1{n^2}\sum_{x, y} d(x, y)$$
between nodes in a network $G = (X,E)$ with $n$ nodes is
small, or smaller than one would naively expect.
In popular culture, the phenomenon is known as "six degrees of separation".
It goes at least back to experiments conducted in the 1960s
by the Yale psychologist Stanley [Milgram] (who is even better known
for another [experiment] designed by him).

In a similar way, the **co-star graph** (with actors as nodes, and edges
between two actors whenever they starred in a common film) as
maintained by the [IMDb], has been used to define the **Bacon number**
of an actor as their distance to the American actor [Kevin Bacon].

The presence of short paths certainly has some relevance in relation
to the potential speed of information (or diseases) travelling through
the network.

## Triadic Closure

Networks evolve over time, edges come and go.  The concept of triadic closure
is concerned with the presence of _triangles_ in a network:
if node $A$ is connected to nodes $B$ and $C$, is $B$ connected to $C$?

![triadic]

**Clustering Coefficient.**
A set of nodes in a graph with the property that
any two distinct nodes are joined by an edge is called
a **clique** (in other words, a clique is a subset of the nodes
such that the induced subgraph is complete).

The graph below contains two cliques of four nodes each.
![Cliques in a graph][cliques]

A clique of $m$ nodes has $\binom{m}2 = \frac12 m(m-1)$ edges,
e.g., a clique of $4$ nodes has $\frac{4 \cdot 3}2  = 6$
edges.

The clustering coefficient of a node $A$ measures, how close
the set $N(A)$ of friends of $A$ comes to being a clique:
if the induced subgraph on $N(A)$ has $f$ edges, then the
**clustering coefficient** of the node $A$ is defined as the fraction
$f/\binom{m}2$.
This is a number between $0$ and $1$.

Triadic closure increases the clustering coefficient.  In a social
network, there are incentives for triadic closure to happen.  If
person $A$ is friends with $B$ and $C$, this provides opportunities for $B$
and $C$ to meet and become friends.  On the other hand, $B$ not being
friends with $C$ can be a source of stress for $A$, who has to attend to
their friends separately.  More generally, a lower clustering
coefficient can mean that more work is required to maintain a circle
of friends.

## Bridges; local Bridges

An edge $AB$ is called a **bridge** if deleting the edge would cause $A$
and $B$ to lie in different connected components.  (In other words, if
the edge $AB$ is a bridge then it is the only route from $A$ to $B$).

**Example.**  The edge $AB$ in the graph below is clearly a bridge.

![picture0]


This notion might not be very useful for the study of social networks,
as cycles and short paths make bridges very rare, or computationally
expensive to detect.

More interesting than the _global_ notion of a bridge, is the
_local_ notion of a local brigde.

An edge $AB$ is a **local bridge** if $N(A) \cap N(B) = \emptyset$,
i.e., if $A$ and $B$ have no friends in common.

**Example.**  The edge $AB$ in the graph below is a local bridge.

![picture1]

Deleting a local bridge $AB$ increases the distance between
$A$ and $B$ to at least 3.
This new distance is called the **span** of the local bridge.

A local bridge is the conceptual opposite of triadic closure:
an edge $AB$ is a local bridge if and only it is not involved in
any triangle.  (Proof?)

## Strong and Weak Ties

In many examples it is possible to distinguish between different
levels of _strength_ of the links of a network.  Here, we are going to
study networks with (only) two types of edges: **strong ties**
(corresponding to close friends, say), and **weak ties**
(corresponding to acquaintances).

The assumption that triadic closure is more likely to happen in the
presence of strong links can be formalized as the following
property.

<div class="note" markdown="1">
**Strong Triadic Closure Property**.
    A node $A$ violates the Strong Triadic Closure Property
    if it has strong ties with two other nodes $B$ and $C$, and there
    is no edge at all between $B$ and $C$.  A node $A$ satisfies the
    Strong Triadic Closure Property if it does not violate it.
</div>

**Example.** In the graph below, the strong edges have a label
($s$) and the weak edges don't.  Each node of this graph satisfies the
Strong Triadic Closure Property:  whenever a node has two strongly tied neighbours, there is a tie (weak or strong) between those neighbours.

![strong and weak ties][picture2]


Triadic closure establishes a connection between the local notion
of link strength and the structural notion of local brigdes, as follows.

<div class="note" markdown="1">
**Proposition.** If a node $A$ in a network satisfies the Strong Triadic
Closure Property and is involved in at least two strong ties, then any
local bridge it is involved in must be a weak tie.
</div>

In other words, assuming that all nodes in a network satisfy the
Strong Triadic Closure Property and have sufficiently many strong
ties, local bridges are necessarily weak ties.

**Proof.** Suppose that node $A$ does satisfy the Strong Triadic Closure
Property and is involved in at least two strong ties.  For a
contradiction, suppose the edge $AB$ is a local bridge _and_ a strong
tie.  As $AB$ is a local bridge, nodes $A$ and $B$ have no friends in
common.  Let $AC$ be another strong tie involving $A$.  Then the Strong
Triadic Closure Property requires the existence of an edge $BC$, making
$C$ a common friend of $A$ and $B$, contradiction.

Simplyfying assumptions (like the Strong Triadic Closure Property) are
useful when they lead to statements that are robust in practice, in
the sense that qualitative conclusions still hold in approximate
forms, even when the assumptions are slightly relaxed.

The surprising strength of weak ties
(as experienced in the case of information leading to a new job
or other new opportunities
typically coming from distant acquaintances)
can be partially explained in this framework.
Links connecting people to new sources of
information tend to be local bridges of
a certain "span", which by the above are necessarily
weak ties.  The Stanford sociologist Mark Granovetter
has pioneered the theoretical study of social networks along such lines
in the 1970s.

Today, digital communication networks allow for empirical verifications
of theoretical predictions.

The **Twitter** network, for example, has its users as **nodes**, and
one can use its social network features to distinguish strong and weak
ties.  For example, a _weak_ tie can correspond to one user
_following_ another, and a _strong_ tie can correspond to at least two
messages directly addressed at another user.  An empirical study of
the social network with its strong and weak ties defined in this way,
shows that people have vastly different numbers of followees (between
none and more than 1000), and the number of strong ties tends to
increase with the number of followees.  However, as soon as the nuber
of followees reaches 400, the number of strong ties seems to stabilize
at around 50.  An explanation of this phenomenon can be that it
requires little effort to "follow" a large number of Twitter users.
But it requires time and energy to maintain a strong tie relationship,
and there are only so many hours in a day ...
