Random Graphs are discussed in [Newman, Chapter 12]
and [Barabasi, Chapter 3].

**Random Graphs.**
A [random graph] is a mathematical model of a network.
Random graphs can be defined so that certain parameters of
the network have fixed values, but other aspects of the network
are randomly assigned.
The simples example of a random graph is
the network $G(n,m)$ with fixed numbers $n$ of nodes and
$m$ of edges, placed randomly between the vertices.

**The Giant Component.** Large, complex networks often have one giant
component that contains a significant proportion of the nodes.
Erdős and Rényi (1960) have found this to be almost certainly the case
with a random graph on $n$ vertices with $\frac{n}{2}$ edges.
