Links in a network are either within groups or between groups.
The links between groups typically are weak links.  **Community detection**
is concerned with the question whether these links, or rather the groups
they connect, can be identified from the network structure.
Here, a group (or community) is a subset of the nodes of the network
that has relatively many links between its members, and
relatively few links to the other groups in the network.
In contrast to the classical problem of **graph partitioning**,
the number and sizes of the groups is not prescribed.
Algorithmically, community detection is a very complex task,
as in principle all $2^n$ subsets of an $n$-node network
need to be considered.  Many algorithms have been suggested that
look for acceptable but not necessarily optimal solutions to
this problem.  Here, we study one such algorithm, based on a concept
of **betweenness centrality**, following [Easley-Kleinberg, Chapter 3.6].
