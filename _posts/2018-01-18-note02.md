    A graph can serve as a mathematical model of a network.
</div>

**Example.**  The internet in December 1970.  Nodes are computers,
connected by a link if they can directly communicate with each other.
At the time, only 13 computers participated in that network.

![the internet in december 1970][arpa]

As far as the network structure is concerned, the following diagram
contains the same information, without the distracting details of the
US geography.

<div id="arpa"></div>

<script>
(function() {
var width = 500,
    height = 300;

var color = d3.scale.category10();

var force = d3.layout.force()
    .charge(-200)
    .gravity(0.05)
    .linkDistance(80)
    .size([width, height]);

var svg = d3.select("#arpa").append("svg")
    .attr("width", width)
    .attr("height", height);

d3.json("/data/arpa.json", function(error, graph) {
  force
      .nodes(graph.nodes)
      .links(graph.links)
      .start();

  var link = svg.selectAll(".link")
      .data(graph.links)
    .enter().append("line")
      .attr("class", "link")
      .style("stroke", function(d) { return color(d.value); })
      .style("stroke-width", function(d) { return 4; });

  // Create the groups under svg

    .classed('group', true);

  });

//        .attr("cy", function(d) { return d.y; });
  });
});
})();

## Simple Graphs

<div class="note" markdown="1">
**Definition.** A (simple) __graph__
is a pair $G = (X, E)$, consisting of a (finite) set $X$ of
objects, called __nodes__ or __vertices__ or __points__,
and a subset $E \subseteq \binom{X}{2}$
of __links__ or __edges__.
</div>

Usually, $n$ is used to denote the number of vertices of a graph,
$n = |X|$,
and $m$ for the number of edges, $m = |E|$.

Here, $\binom{X}{2}$, pronounced as "$X$ choose 2",
is the set of all $2$-element subsets of $X$.
(The notation is motivated by the fact that if $X$ has $n$ elements then
$\binom{X}{2}$ has $\binom{n}{2} = \frac12 n(n-1)$ elements.)
Obviously, $m \leq \binom{n}{2}$.

**Example.**
$X = \\{ A, B, C, D \\}$ and $E = \\{ AB, BC, BD, CD \\}$
(where $AB$ is short for $\\{ A, B \\}$).

![graph1]

The example also illustrates a typical way how diagrams of graphs are drawn:
nodes are represented by small circles, and edges by lines connecting the nodes.

## Adjacency Matrix

A useful, algebraic, way to represent a graph is given by its __adjacency matrix__.  This is square matrix $A$, with rows and columns corresponding to the vertices of the graph, and an entry $1$ or $0$ in row $i$, column $j$, if
the corresponding vertices are joined by an edge or not.
The edge $AB$ in the example above this gives an entry $1$
in row 1 (corresponding to vertex $A$) and column 2 (corresponding to
vertex $B$.  And another entry $1$ in row 2 column 1.  The full adjacency matrix
of the above graph is as follows.

$A = \left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
0&1&0&0\\\\\\\\
1&0&1&1\\\\\\\\
0&1&0&1\\\\\\\\
0&1&1&0
\end{array}
\right]$

Note that $A = (a_{ij})$, like every adjacency matrix of a simple
graph, is _symmetric_ (about the diagonal): $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$ for all
$i, j$.  Also, all diagonal entries are $0$.

##  Directed Graphs, Multigraphs

In this simple setting, two nodes are either connected or not (that
is, there are no multiple links) and if node $x$ is connected to node
$y$, then it is also true that $y$ is connected to $x$: the edges set
up a _symmetric_ relationship between nodes.  If we want to express
more complex real world relationships, we can make use of the more
complex structure of _directed_ graphs, where edges have directions
(drawn as arrows), possibly pointing back to the node they came from
(forming loops, or self-edges), or even with multiple edges between
the same two nodes.  A graph that has multiple edges between nodes is
usually called a _multigraph_.

![graph2]

The adjacency matrix $A$ of a directed graph has an entry $a_{ij} = 1$
whenever there is an edge from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ (in that
order!)  in the graph, and entries $0$ in all other positions.  For
example,

$A = \left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
0&1&0&0\\\\\\\\
0&0&1&1\\\\\\\\
0&0&0&1\\\\\\\\
0&0&0&0
\end{array}
\right]$

A simple graph can be regarded as a directed graph by reading every
undirected edge as two directed edges between the end points,
one going forward and one coming back.

The adjacency matrix is capable of storing additional information,
like weights or multiplicities of edges or loops, if that is required.
We will soon see, how algebraic operations like matrix multiplication
can be used to obtain information about a network from its adjacency matrix.

## Degree

The _degree_ of a vertex $x$ in a simple graph is the number of
vertices it is connected to in the graph (it's number of _friends_).
The degree can serve as a (simple) measure of the importance of a node
in a network.  The _average degree_ of the nodes in a network depends
(only) on the number $n$ of nodes, and the number $m$ of edges in the
network.

Writing $k_i$ for the degree of vertex $x_i$, this number
easily be determined from the adjacency matrix $A$ as the number of
entries $1$ in row $i$ (or in column $i$):

$k_i = \sum_j a_{ij} = \sum_j a_{ji}$.

As every edge contributes to the degree of $2$ nodes, the sum of all degrees
equals twice the number of edges:

$\sum_i k_i = 2m$,

whence the _average degree_ is

$c = \frac1n \sum_i k_i = \frac{2m}{n}$.

## Graphs are Relations

Recall the following definitions.

<div class="note" markdown="1">
**Definition.**  A __relation__ from a set $X$ to a set $Y$ is (nothing but) a subset
$R$ of the Cartesian product $X \times Y = \\{(x, y) :  x \in X,\, y \in Y \\}$.
We say that $x \in X$ is __$R$-related__ to $y \in Y$ whenever $(x, y) \in R$
and then write $x R y$.
</div>

The adjacency matrix of a relation $R \subseteq X \times Y$
is the matrix with one row for each element $x \in X$ and one column for each
element $y \in Y$, and it has an entry $1$ in row $x$ and column $y$
if $x R y$, and entries $0$ otherwise.

In many cases, $Y = X$.
If $Y = X$, we say that $R$ is a relation __on__ $X$.  Such a relation
can have one or more of the following properties.

<div class="note" markdown="1">
* (R) $R$ is __reflexive__ if $xRx$ for all $x \in X$;
* (S) $R$ is __symmetric__ if $xRy$ implies $yRx$ for all $x, y \in X$;
* (T) $R$ is __transitive__ if $xRy$ and $yRz$ imply that $xRz$ for all $x, y, z \in X$;

* (I) $R$ is __irreflexive__ if not $xRx$ for all $x \in X$;
* (A) $R$ is __antisymmetric__ if $xRy$ and $yRx$ imply that
$x = y$ for all $x, y \in X$.
</div>

A relation that is (RST), i.e., reflexive, symmetric and transitive, is
called an __equivalence relation__, and it partitions the set $X$ into
(mutually disjoint) parts, called __equivalence classes__.  A relation
that is (RAT) is called a __partial order__ (such as the *divides*
partial order on the natural numbers, or the *contains* relation
between the subsets of a set).

In view of these notions, we can now describe simple graphs and some
of their properties
as follows: A *simple* graph with node set $X$ is a *symmetric*,
*irreflexive* relation on $X$.  A *directed* graph with node set $X$
is *irreflexive* if it has *no loops*.  And it is *antisymmetric* if
every edge has a *unique direction*.

The article [Counting Transitive Relations] (in the *Journal of
Integer Sequences*) contains a systematic account on the various types
of relations that can be distinguished by these 5 properties, and a
discussion of how to count them (up to equivalence) in case the
underlying set $X$ is finite.

## Composition

Relations can be composed, like functions.  If $R$ is a relation
from a set $X$ to a set $Y$, and if $S$ is a relation from $Y$ to a set $Z$,
then the __composite relation__ $R \circ S$ is the relation
from $X$ to $Z$, defined by $x (R \circ S) z$ if there is a
an element $y \in Y$ such that $x R y$ and $y S z$.

The adjacency matrix of the composite relation $R \circ S$
is essentially the (matrix) product of the adjacency matrices
of the individual relations $R$ and $S$.
If $A = (a_{ij})$ is the adjacency matrix of $R$, and $B = (b_{jk})$ the adjacency matrix of $S$,
then the $i,k$-entry of the product $AB$ is

$$(AB)_{ik} = \sum_{j} a_{ij} b_{jk}$$,

which is exactly the _number_ of elements $y \in Y$ such that $x_i R
y$ aand $y S z_k$.  All it needs for $x_i$ to be $(R \circ S)$-related
to $z_k$ is this number to be at least $1$.  Hence, replacing all
nonzero entries in the product matrix $AB$ with $1$ yields the
adjacency matrix of the composite $R \circ S$.

Let's write $A \circ B$ for this matrix.

##  New Networks from Old

In many situations, simple graphs are preferred over directed graphs.
A simple method of turning a directed graph into a simple graph is
given by ignoring the directions of the arrows, i.e., by reading each
directed edge as an undirected edge.  Some information will get lost
on the way.  Other methods of producing a simple graph from a directed
one are based on composition of relations.  We will see that the same
method can be used to produce simple projections from bipartite
graphs.

##  Products of Relations

Suppose that $A$ is the (square) adjacency matrix of
a (undirected) network, corresponding to a relation $R$.

Then the matrix $A \circ A$ is the adjacency matrix of the
relation $R \circ R$, which is defined as follows, using $-$ as
symbol for the relation $R$:

$x (R \circ R) z \iff x - y - z$ for some element $y$.

Note that in particular

$x (R \circ R) x \iff x - y - x$ for some element $y$,

that is, $x$ is $R \circ R$ related to itself, whenever $x$ is
$R$-related to at least one element $y$.


If $A = (a_{ij})$ is the adjacency matrix of a relation $R$ (from $X$
to $Y$), then the _transposed matrix_ $A^T = (a_{ji})$ is the adjacency matrix
of the __opposite relation__

$R^{\mathrm{op}} = \\{ (y, x) \in Y \times X : xRy \\}$.

In a directed graph, the corresponding opposite relation is obtained by
reverting all arrows:

$x R^{\mathrm{op}} y \iff y R x$.

Now, composing $R$ with its opposite yields a new relation,
using $\to$ as symbol for the relation:

$x (R \circ R^{\mathrm{op}}) z \iff x \to y \leftarrow z$ for some element $y$.

The adjacency matrix of this (symmetric!) relation is the matrix $A \circ A^T$.
In the context of citations between scientific papers, this
network is called _bibliographic coupling_:  two articles are
linked in this way, if they both cite the same third paper.

Similarly,

$x (R^{\mathrm{op}} \circ R) z \iff x \leftarrow y \to z$ for some element $y$.

The adjacency matrix of this (symmetric!) relation is the matrix $A^T \circ A$.
In the context of citations between scientific papers, this
network is called the  _cocitation network_:  two articles are
linked in this way, if they both are cited by the same third paper.

Note that the $x,z$-entry in the proper _matrix product_ $A^T \cdot A$
is the _number_ of articles $z$ citing both $x$ and $y$.
In particular, the diagonal entry in row $x$ and column $x$ is
the total number of articles citing $x$.

##  Bipartite Graphs, Affilitation Networks

A graph $G = (X, E)$ is bipartite if
$X = B \sqcup W$ ($X$ is a disjoint union of $B$lack and $W$hite vertices),
so that

$\|e \cap B\| = \|e \cap W\| = 1$ for all $e \in E$,

(each edge links a black vertex with a white vertex.)  Bipartite
networks are well suited for representing affiliation networks.
Such networks are formed fpor exampled through membership in groups,
letting black vertices stand for the members, the white vertices for
the groups, and using edges between members and groups to link every
member with all the groups they are a member of.

Here is an example of a bipartite graph.

![bipartite1]

However, not every diagram of a bipartite network has the
white nodes neatly separated from the black ones.  Here is an
example of a bipartite graph arising from a chess board pattern.

![bipartite2]

### Projections

A bipartite network can be projected onto each type of vertices:
Two members are related if they are members in the same group;
two groups are related if they have a member in common.  In terms
of adjacency matrices this works as follows.

Let $A$ be the adjacency matrix of the (undirected) bipartite graph.
Then, listing the elements of the vertex set $X$ in such a way that
$B$ comes first, followed by $W$, the matrix $A$ is a $2 \times 2$ block matrix:

$A = \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
0 & C \\\\\\\\
C^T & 0
\end{array}
\right]$,

where the blocks on the diagonal consist entirely of zeros, as there
are no edges between vertices of the same color.  And as $A$ is
symmetric, the block below the diagonal is the transpose of the block
$C$ above the diagonal.

As $A = A^T$, we have

$A^T \circ A = A \circ A^T = A \circ A = \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
C \circ C^T & 0 \\\\\\\\
0 & C^T \circ C
\end{array}
\right]$,

where $C \circ C^T$ is the adjacency matrix of the projection onto
the vertex set $B$: ${\bullet} - {\circ} - {\bullet}$,
and $C^T \circ C$ is the adjacency matrix of the projection onto
the vertex set $W$: ${\circ} - {\bullet} - {\circ}$.

hierarchical representations to modern network representations of data.
